### What can I leverage

* desktop corp, bbvpn.bloomberg.com has access to my remote desktop in NY
* desktop dev

### What we can possibly fix

* bbvpn macbook's connection to bbvpn: this should be available even in public WiFi

### What I cannot access

* School server 128.97.98.11
* Google application engine console configuration page
* 

### Client side cannot assign requested address (telnet), tunnelblick keeps reconnecting
